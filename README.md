# kstreet binary repo notes:
*Last Updated January 15, 2014*

**What Is This Fork In Here For?**

These binaries are in the kstreet GitHub account because they are referenced and currently used with:

- A private `.MvxPlugins` project needs references to the `Cheesebaron.MvxPlugins.ModernHttpClient.*` projects and that repo relies on the [BINARY releases](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient/releases) from [https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient).

**How Fresh Is This?**

- The latest binaries available in this repo are from the [1.1.0 release](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient/releases/tag/1.1.0) of the `paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient`
 [repo](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient).
